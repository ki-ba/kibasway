# kibasway
my config files for sway, swaybar, wofi and foot.

Very simple configuration for Sway with gaps and custom waybar, foot theme.


## Features

just style

## Installation

clone in your home directory, then run ```.kibasway-install```

## Dependencies

Of course you need sway, waybar, and wofi. You can chose not to use wofi and/or waybar : just remember to remove wofi and waybar directories in your .config and to edit ```~/.config/sway/config```  accordingly.
